# PandExo numerical parity report

Generated 2026-07-12 by `run_parity.py` + `make_report.py` in this directory.

Both sides run on the SAME current Pandeia backend, so every difference below is an ESTIMATOR/policy difference, not an engine calibration difference. PandExo is current master (commit in the provenance block). Configuration: constant transit depth 0.01, transit duration 2.8036 h, equal out-of-transit baseline, saturation limit 80%, no noise floor, native (R=None) grids.

## Figures (regenerate with `make_parity_plots.py`)

These show the quantities that match 1:1 -- the parity result. The depth-uncertainty difference (a noise-model difference, not a configuration one) is quantified in the tables and Findings below, not plotted.

- **parity_config_timing.png** -- selected groups, integration time, and integration count, this tool vs PandExo, on the 1:1 line (log-log). Every mode/star lands on the diagonal except PRISM's known group floor (ngroup_min=2 vs PandExo's 1 on a bright star).
- **parity_extracted_flux.png** -- G395H extracted stellar count rate, per-wavelength overlay with a ratio strip (per-pixel jitter + binned median). The curves coincide (systematic ratio ~0.997).

## What is bit-identical, and why the rest is not

The two are INDEPENDENT tools calling the same Pandeia engine, so only what is read straight from the shared engine is bit-for-bit identical; anything each computes on its own agrees closely but not exactly. This is a property of a cross-tool test, not a defect -- forcing bit-equality would mean one tool copying the other's numbers, which is not a validation.

- **Bit-identical (max difference exactly 0):** the instrument configuration (subarray, readout, disperser, filter, aperture, background) and the extracted WAVELENGTH GRID -- every extracted pixel, every mode and star (verified: max |Δλ| = 0).
- **Groups agree to ≤1 on the moderate/bright stars, to ~1% relative (up to 5 groups absolute) on the faint Ks=13 star:** each tool independently optimizes the ramp to the same 80% saturation target; the freedom left is rounding to an integer group count (e.g. G395H 124 vs 125; faint-star ramps of ~500-1000 groups differ by up to 5). Per-group integration time matches to <0.1%; total integration time and count then inherit the group choice (up to ~5.5% where a single group of ~16 dominates, bright G395H; ~2.5% bright MIRI). Only VALID configurations are compared: PRISM saturates on the two bright stars (both tools flag it; this tool floors at ngroup=2 while PandExo drops to ngroup=1) and is excluded there, and is compared on the faint star where it is unsaturated and matches (ngroup 20/20).
- **Extracted flux agrees to a systematic ~0.3%** (binned median 0.997 for G395H), with per-pixel scatter from the two tools' independent extraction of the same 2D calculation -- photon-level for the smooth NIRSpec/MIRI traces (MIRI LRS matches to ~0.15%), larger for the curved NIRISS SOSS order-1 trace and the saturating low-R PRISM. The tool integrates over bins, so the per-pixel jitter averages out; the systematic is what enters the noise. The narrow downward spikes in this tool's flux are STELLAR ABSORPTION LINES in Pandeia's PHOENIX spectrum (hydrogen recombination -- e.g. Brackett-α 4.052 μm, Pfund-δ 3.297 μm -- plus molecular bands on cool stars, so they multiply on cooler targets: 9 lines at 6250 K, 193 at 4500 K); PandExo's separately-loaded stellar spectrum smooths them. They are physically real, cancel in the in/out transit-depth ratio, and wash out in binning.

Columns: sigma ratio = (this tool's per-pixel transit-depth sigma) / (PandExo's), median [5th, 95th percentile] over matched pixels. 'matched' uses PandExo's integration counts in the tool formula (isolates the noise model); 'policy' uses the tool's own floor(T/t_int) counts (adds the integration-counting policy). flux ratio compares extracted stellar count rates (engine parity; expect 1.0000).

## Findings

1. **Configuration parity: achieved.** With the registry's explicit TSO readout patterns, PandExo's extraction strategy (apertures/annuli), and the ecliptic/medium background, the two sides agree on the extracted wavelength grids (every pixel matches), extracted count rates (flux-ratio medians 0.987-1.03), selected groups (within 1 on the moderate/bright stars; within ~1% relative, up to 5 groups absolute, on the faint Ks=13 star), per-group integration times (<0.1%; total t_int inherits the group choice, up to ~5.5% where one group of ~16 dominates), and integration counts (within rounding policy). Saturation behavior matches: pixels PandExo masks as saturated are the pixels this tool excludes.

2. **The remaining sigma difference is the noise model itself, and it is one-sided.** This tool propagates pandeia's full extracted noise (correlated ramp/read noise, background, dark, IPC, quantum-yield excess); PandExo's default 'fml' calculation is an analytic ramp formula that sits within a few percent of pure photon noise in the NIR. The attribution tables above show the variance excess over photon counts on both sides; their ratio reproduces the observed sigma ratios (e.g. G395H: 1.220/1.014 = 1.203 ~= 1.108^2). This tool is therefore systematically CONSERVATIVE relative to PandExo: ~2-24% higher sigma for NIRSpec/NIRISS/NIRCam on matched configurations (up to ~31% under the policy configs on the faint Ks=13 star), and larger for MIRI LRS (~33-56%), where the deep-red background and detector terms dominate and the analytic formula under-represents them. For context, published achieved-vs-PandExo noise ratios (COMPASS G395H 1.05-1.12; MIRI LRS ~1.15-1.2 above random-noise simulations) fall on the same side, between the two models for NIRSpec.

3. **Residual policy differences (documented, small):** integration counts are floored here vs rounded in PandExo (at most one integration per window); ngroup_min is 2 here while PandExo will select 1 group (PRISM on a bright star); the symmetric in/out approximation adds ~+0.5% sigma at 1% depth (grows with depth; docstring in noise.pixel_depth_variance).

4. **What may be claimed:** the instrument configuration, timing, group optimization, saturation handling, and extraction of this tool match current PandExo on the current engine. Absolute sigmas are NOT PandExo-identical and are not labeled as such: they are pandeia-extracted-noise forecasts, conservative relative to PandExo's analytic noise by the mode-dependent margins quantified above.
