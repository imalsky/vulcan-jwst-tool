# PandExo numerical parity harness

The 2026-07-12 external audit made mode-by-mode numerical parity against
current PandExo a release gate for any "PandExo-style" precision claim. This
directory is that gate. `REPORT.md` and `parity_summary.json` are the
committed artifacts of the latest run; the raw per-pixel results live under
`$JWST_TOOL_OUTPUT_DIR/pandexo_parity/` (generated, not tracked).

## What it does

`run_parity.py` runs the SAME star and instrument configurations through

1. this package's Pandeia worker plus its box-transit depth-error
   propagation (`noise.pixel_depth_variance`), and
2. current PandExo master (`pandexo_worker.py`, a standalone script that
   runs inside the current-Pandeia conda env),

both on the SAME current engine/refdata generation (2026.2). Differences are
therefore estimator and policy differences, never engine calibration
differences. The tool's default pinned 3.0 backend is untouched.

Per mode it compares: detector configuration (subarray, readout pattern,
filter, disperser), the extracted wavelength grid, selected group count,
integration time, integration-counting policy, extracted stellar count
rates, and the per-pixel transit-depth sigma with no noise floor. The sigma
comparison is reported twice: with PandExo's integration counts substituted
into the tool's formula (noise-model parity in isolation) and with the
tool's own floor(T/t_int) counts (the shipped policy).

## Known, intended differences

* The tool floors partial integrations (`int(T/t_cycle)`); PandExo rounds.
  Worth at most one integration per window.
* The tool uses the out-of-transit flux and noise for both in- and
  out-of-transit terms (symmetric approximation, documented in
  `noise.pixel_depth_variance`); PandExo propagates separate in-transit
  counts with the (1-depth) factor. At depth 0.01 the tool is expected to
  sit ~0.5% ABOVE PandExo (conservative), growing with depth.
* Group-count caps: the registry's `ngroup_max` can bind before PandExo's
  optimizer does; where it binds the tool uses a shorter ramp (slightly
  higher sigma, never lower).

## Running it

Requires a conda env with `pandeia.engine==2026.2` and PandExo master, the
extracted `pandeia_data-2026.2-jwst` and `pandeia_psfs-2026.2-jwst` trees,
and a synphot CDBS with the phoenix grid, CALSPEC Vega, and the Bessell
J/H/K + 2MASS Ks bandpasses (fetch missing ones from
`https://ssb.stsci.edu/trds/comp/nonhst/`). Then:

```
JWST_TOOL_PANDEIA_PYTHON=<env python> JWST_TOOL_PANDEIA_REFDATA=<data tree> JWST_TOOL_PANDEIA_PSF_DIR=<psf tree> JWST_TOOL_DATA_DIR=<dir containing cdbs/> JWST_TOOL_OUTPUT_DIR=<scratch output> python validation/pandexo_parity/run_parity.py
python validation/pandexo_parity/make_report.py
```

All five environment variables are required and fail loudly; no machine
paths are baked into the repository.
