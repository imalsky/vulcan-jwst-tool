"""One measurement operator per instrument mode: count-space binning shared by
the noise, the model, and every Jacobian row.

Why this module exists (2026-07-11 external audit, P0.1): the tool used to
report inverse-variance combined bin errors (noise.py) while binning the model
and Jacobians with local wavelength/trapezoid weights (detect.py). Those are
two DIFFERENT estimators, so the forecast model point was not the expectation
value of the statistic whose variance was being quoted. Everything now goes
through one operator built from the Pandeia extracted-pixel grid:

    pixels -> bin     d_b   = sum_i(w_i d_i) / sum_i(w_i),   w_i = F_i
    variance          Var_b = sum_i(w_i^2 Var_i) / (sum_i w_i)^2
    model -> pixel    d_i   = average of the piecewise-linear model over the
                              pixel's wavelength cell (midpoint edges)

Count-space weights (w_i = extracted stellar count rate F_i) are the estimator
real reductions implement: the binned light curve is the SUM of extracted
counts across the bin's pixels, so the fitted bin depth is the flux-weighted
mean of the per-pixel depths. In the photon-dominated limit (Var_i ~ 1/F_i)
this coincides with inverse-variance weighting; where background or read noise
contribute, count-space is slightly wider -- the honest variance of the
estimator actually used. The same weights bin the model, the removed-molecule
model, and the Jacobians, so signal, derivative, and noise all describe the
same statistic.

The model is averaged over each pixel's wavelength cell (exact integral of the
piecewise-linear model), never point-sampled, so a model grid finer than the
pixel grid (e.g. MIRI LRS) cannot alias. Where the FINAL binning approaches
the instrument's NATIVE resolving power (MIRI LRS, PRISM, blue SOSS),
detect.evaluate_mode additionally blurs the model -- the depth, the
removed-molecule depth, and EVERY Jacobian row, with one flux weight -- to
R_native via smooth_to_native_r (the flux-weighted count-ratio Gaussian LSF
in this module) BEFORE the cell average; for high-R modes that kernel is
unresolved by the model grid and the blur is a no-op. The Gaussian R(lambda)
kernel is an approximation to the full Pandeia response matrix
(monochromatic impulses through the 3D engine); impulse-response validation
against the engine is a documented pending gate, and Pandeia's extraction
already carries PSF/throughput into F_i and sigma_i.

    STELLAR-FLUX WEIGHTING (``weight``, 2026-07-12 re-audit item 2). The
    instrument does not measure the LSF-average of the transit depth. It
    measures LSF-averaged in- and out-of-transit COUNTS and forms their ratio:
    with stellar flux F and depth d,

        d_obs = 1 - L[F (1 - d)] / L[F] = L[F d] / L[F],

    i.e. the FLUX-WEIGHTED LSF mean of d, not the flat mean L[d]. The two
    differ wherever F varies across a kernel (a stellar line, a throughput
    gradient, the SOSS blue drop-off): the flat blur mislocated the depth
    signal by tens of ppm near structured stellar spectra. Pass the stellar
    flux at ``wl_model`` as ``weight`` to get the correct ratio; ``None`` (or a
    constant weight) reduces exactly to the flat blur. F is only resolved to
    the extracted pixel scale, so sub-pixel stellar lines cannot be recovered
    here (a documented limitation); this corrects the pixel-resolved structure,
    which is what the native-R blur redistributes. The operator stays LINEAR in
    d for fixed F, so a Jacobian row blurs with the SAME weight as the depth.

    Implementation: cell-average the piecewise-linear model (and the weight)
    onto a uniform ln-lambda grid finer than the narrowest kernel (flux-
    conserving, no aliasing of unresolved lines), convolve with the
    wavelength-dependent Gaussian, and interpolate back onto the model points
    inside the band. The working band extends 5 sigma beyond [band_lo, band_hi]
    so one-sided kernels never touch the returned region.
