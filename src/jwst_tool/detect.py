"""Detection-significance math: bin the model per instrument THROUGH THE SAME
count-space measurement operator as the noise, combine with the per-bin depth
uncertainty, and score the science goal.

Model, removed-molecule model, Jacobians, and noise all go through one
operator (binning.build_operator, flux-weighted): the binned model is the
expectation value of the same estimator whose variance the noise module
reports. Pixels Pandeia flags as fully saturated are excluded from the
operator; partially saturated pixels are kept but counted per bin
(n_pix_partial_sat) so affected channels are visible, not silent.

For modes whose final bins approach the NATIVE resolving power (MIRI LRS
R~40-160, NIRSpec PRISM R~30-300, blue SOSS) the model is first blurred to
the instrument's R(lambda) exported by the pandeia worker
(binning.smooth_to_native_r); for high-R gratings this is automatically a
no-op, matching the sub-ppm edge-effect estimate at R_bin=100.

sigma_detect is a CONDITIONAL MATCHED-TEMPLATE S/N at the specified
atmospheric state: the nested-model chi-square distance between the full
spectrum and the spectrum with one molecule's opacity removed, with the
calibration nuisances profiled out --

    chi2 = s^T W s - b^T A^{-1} b,   W = diag(1/sigma^2)  or  C^{-1},
    b = U W s,  A = U W U^T,         s_b = d_full - d_without_X

where W is the diagonal metric under the "random" noise scenario (the
default; the correlated scenarios are experimental) or the inverse of the
full scenario covariance C (noise.build_cov: the floor EXCESS re-allocated
between white and ln-wavelength-smooth parts at identical per-bin totals),
and the rows of U are one constant depth offset PLUS one
step per extra detector segment (NRS1|NRS2 for the two-detector NIRSpec
gratings: real G395H fits universally float such offsets, at the
tens-of-ppm level -- Moran+2023, Madhusudhan+2023) PLUS, under a scenario
that says so, one centered slope per segment (real per-visit fits float
linear trends). The offset/step/slope profiling removes the part of the
molecule's signature a real fit would reabsorb into the continuum or
per-detector calibration. It is NOT a retrieval detection significance:
temperature, clouds, and the other abundances are not re-fit, so it
upper-bounds what a full retrieval would report. When a Fisher Jacobian is
available, ``sigma_detect_proj`` additionally projects the template against
the T-P and lnR0 derivative directions (still conditional -- chemistry and
clouds stay fixed) and is the number to prefer for narrow margins.

Multi-transit extrapolation uses the noise-model components (the random term
scales as 1/N; the minimum floor is a hard lower bound at every N), so
"transits to target" saturates honestly instead of promising 1/sqrt(N)
forever.
