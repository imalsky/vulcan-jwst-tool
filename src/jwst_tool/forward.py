"""Forward model runner: VULCAN-JAX photochemistry -> ExoJax transmission spectrum.

Two faces:

* Imported by the GUI (light): ``params_key`` / ``cache_path`` / ``load_result``
  touch only the disk cache -- no JAX, no VULCAN, no ExoJax imports.
* Run as a script (heavy):  ``python .../src/jwst_tool/forward.py params.json``
  (equivalently ``python -m jwst_tool.forward params.json``)
  runs the live pipeline and writes the npz cache entry. Progress goes to
  stdout as "[fwd] ..." lines; machine-parsable "[fwd] PROG <frac> <label>"
  lines drive the GUI progress bar.

Planets: every system in ``planets.PLANETS`` (plus "custom") runs on the same
validated W39b SNCHO machinery -- the planet identity (gravity, radius, star,
orbit, UV spectrum) is injected via cfg_overrides for the chemistry and via
profile rp_cm/gs_cgs/rstar_cm for the RT. EVERY planet (including WASP-39b)
gets an isothermal structural baseline at a representative temperature; the
requested T-P profile is evaluated on-graph and drives the chemistry AND the
RT. The WASP-39b GCM T-P/Kzz special cases were REMOVED (2026-07-13): no
tp_mode="baseline", no GCM-scaled Kzz, no has_gcm_baseline branches -- a GCM
profile is never silently substituted.

Numerical resolution (was the GUI "fidelity" switch, now three explicit knobs):
    nz         VULCAN chemistry layers; the ExoJax RT grid (art_nlayer) is LOCKED
               equal to nz in run_model, so chemistry and RT share one layer count
    nu_pts     native wavenumber points over the 1-15 um band (native R ~ nu_pts/2.7)
    yconv_cri  steady-state convergence tolerance
    Defaults reproduce the old "fast" tier (nz=100, nu_pts=4000, yconv 1e-2);
    the validated ceiling is the old "high" tier (nz=150, nu_pts=8000, yconv 1e-3).

Atmosphere-structure knobs (all consumed by the same validated pipeline hooks the
retrieval framework uses):

    T-P profile (tp_mode) -- explicit profiles only:
      "isothermal"  T(P) = T_iso  (on-graph tp_eval hook)
      "guillot"     ExoJax atmprof_Guillot(Tirr, Tint, log10 kappa, log10 gamma)
                    with f=0.25 and the planet's surface gravity (on-graph)
      "file"        (v16) an EXPLICIT tabulated T(P) [+ Kzz(P)] table: the
                    shipped W39b evening-terminator profile (the cfg's own
                    atm_file) or a user upload. It drives the hydrostatic
                    grid, the EQ init, the chemistry AND the RT temperature;
                    the cache key carries the file's CONTENT hash
                    (tp_file_sha1), so two tables can never share an entry.
                    There are NO T-P Fisher rows in file mode (a fixed table
                    has no temperature parameter): file-mode Fisher forecasts
                    are CONDITIONAL on the profile being exactly right, which
                    makes the reported sigmas optimistic -- stated in the
                    README and the GUI. The v13 rule stands: a profile is
                    never silently substituted; file mode is an explicit
                    opt-in and the engine override is atm_type="file".
    Kzz (kzz_mode; the lnKzz Fisher row is a multiplicative scale of ANY
    profile, so it survives every mode):
      "const"   constant Kzz = kzz_const cm^2/s (further x kzz_x if given)
      "Pfunc"   Kzz = max(K_max, K_max (K_p_lev/P)^0.4)   [kzz_kmax, kzz_plev]
      "JM16"    Kzz = max(K_deep, 1e5 (300 mbar/P)^0.5)   [kzz_kdeep]
      "file"    the Kzz column of the tp_mode="file" table (requires both)
    Composition (STRUCTURAL since v13 -- set in the cfg elemental abundances,
    FastChem re-initializes at exactly the requested values; one path for
    every composition, including C-rich):
      met_x_solar  metallicity in x solar -- scales the cfg O/C/N/S together
      co_ratio     absolute C/O = N_C/N_O -- sets C_H = co_ratio * O_H
    Physics (cfg_overrides / RT flags; defaults = the previous hard-coded values):
      use_photo     photochemistry on/off (off = thermochem + transport only;
                    FD Fisher works either way since v13; jac_method="ad"
                    requires ON -- the validated jvp regime)
      sl_angle_deg  photolysis zenith angle (deg; 83 = Tsai 2023 terminator slant)
      f_diurnal     diurnal photolysis factor (1.0 = permanent dayside)
      use_moldiff   molecular diffusion on/off (homopause)
      use_rayleigh  H2/He Rayleigh scattering (ON by default from v4; v3 lacked it)
      cloud_on + log_kappa_cloud + alpha_cloud
                    ExoJax power-law cloud deck. Since v16 the two deck
                    parameters can be FREED as Fisher parameters
                    (marginalized): their Jacobian rows are RT-only (like
                    lnR0 -- no chemistry re-solve, no convergence gate), so
                    a cloudy forecast no longer silently conditions on a
                    perfectly-known deck.
      Boundary conditions / transport (v16; every knob is upstream VULCAN
      machinery reached through cfg_overrides, all default OFF = the
      validated baseline):
        use_settling  gravitational settling velocities for condensed
                      particles (requires use_moldiff; REFUSED with
                      use_condense -- the certified S8 recipe pins
                      settling off)
        diff_esc      diffusion-limited escape at the TOA for the listed
                      light species (choose from H / H2 / He)
        top_flux      constant TOA flux rows [species, flux]
                      (molecules cm^-2 s^-1; negative = escape to space)
        bot_flux      constant bottom-boundary rows [species, flux, vdep]
                      (flux in molecules cm^-2 s^-1, deposition velocity
                      vdep in cm s^-1)
      extra_mols    opt-in RT molecules beyond the base 5 (C2H2/H2S/HCN/NH3)
      rt_ptop_bar / rt_integration / rt_dit_res  (v15)
                    ExoJAX RT top pressure (band-saturation "wall" knob),
                    ArtTransPure chord-integration scheme (simpson/trapezoid),
                    and PreMODIT broadening-grid spacing; defaults 1e-8 bar /
                    simpson / 1.0 = the pre-v15 hard-coded values, and the
                    engine's echo of each is verified loudly after the build

Any T-P that leaves the modelable premodit window [320, 2980] K on either grid is
REJECTED with a clear error (never clipped) -- same rule as the retrieval.

Condensation is DETECTION-ONLY (v14; fully removed v8-v13): S8 rainout via
the certified conden-window + whole-column fix-species pin recipe
(CONDEN_CFG). It can never meet a derivative. The pin freezes the reservoir
at a step-sequence-dependent transient, so the converged state is not a
reproducible function of the inputs, and the condensing-layer set /
cold-trap index switch discretely in T. That breaks EVERY differentiation
method: the measured jvp-vs-FD relative error is ~0.91 -- the tangent is
about 91% WRONG (an order-unity failure, NOT a 0.91 agreement ratio or a
9% mismatch) -- and finite differences of pinned transients are equally
untrustworthy. `canonical_params` therefore refuses use_condense with
fisher_params (any jac_method), with photo OFF (a cold no-photo condensing
column has no certifiable longdy steady state), and with use_moldiff OFF
(the growth term IS the molecular-diffusion coefficient); adjoint_diag
refuses condensing states too. The open-system "smooth rainout"
replacement that tried to restore differentiability was measured NO-GO
(preserved on the sibling repos' ``research/smooth-rainout-fisher``
branch, not shipped). GUI-documented footgun: a column too hot to condense
still pins S8 at its end-of-window value -- conden-on does NOT reduce to
conden-off; enable it only where sulfur genuinely condenses.

Aerosol opacity, the Fisher-compatible way: represent clouds/haze as a
DIFFERENTIABLE opacity rather than as chemistry. The ExoJax power-law cloud
deck (``cloud_on`` + ``log_kappa_cloud`` + ``alpha_cloud``) is wired into
the RT, smooth in its parameters, and since v16 both deck parameters can be
freed as Fisher parameters (RT-only Jacobian rows, "fd-rt"/"ad-jvp"
provenance) -- the recommended aerosol path instead of condensation.

Fisher machinery: with ``fisher_params`` set, the runner computes the spectrum
Jacobian d(depth)/d(param) row by row, by one of two methods
(``jac_method``); the method is recorded per row in the npz
(``jac_row_method``) and shown in the GUI:

* "fd" (DEFAULT) -- certified central finite differences ("fd-central"):
  composition rows (lnZ, dlnCO) re-initialize the chemistry per FD point
  (the upstream-VULCAN workflow, valid at ANY composition); lnKzz/T-P rows
  perturb theta on the baseline build; every row passes the h-vs-2h
  consistency gate; lnR0 is an RT-only central difference ("fd-rt").
* "ad" -- one warm-started forward-mode jvp per row ("ad-jvp": the
  validated sensitivity pattern -- continuation from the converged column,
  photochemistry ON required), ~1.7-4x faster per row. Cross-validated
  against the FD rows on W39b defaults: T_iso 0.14%, dlnCO 0.07%, lnKzz
  exact, lnR0 0.9999, lnZ 1.6%. Two stated caveats: the lnZ jvp is the
  FIXED-STRUCTURAL-GRID derivative (the 1.6% gap is the hydrostatic-grid
  rebuild only FD includes), and the dlnCO jvp uses the fixed-O
  differential direction, which is undefined on C-rich baselines where its
  oxygen-reservoir bound b_z <= 0 -- run_model refuses that corner loudly
  (use "fd", which is valid everywhere).

``fisher.py`` turns the Jacobian + the Pandeia noise into parameter forecasts.

Per-molecule "removed" spectra (for detection significance) zero that molecule's
VMR in the RT only -- atmospheric structure (T, mmw) is kept, the standard
nested-model comparison used in observation planning.

# RAISES -- an FD row dominated by solver convergence noise is never reported.
# The reported row is the Richardson combination (4 J_h - J_2h)/3. Cost: a
