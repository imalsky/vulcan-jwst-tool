"""Cross-process limiter for heavy runs (v18.1, public-Space protection).

The live Space is deliberately public, so any visitor can launch multi-minute
forward/ETC/adjoint subprocesses. This caps the number running at once
per instance with OS-level advisory locks; when every slot is busy the GUI
declines the launch with a friendly message instead of queueing (cached
results stay instant; there are no accounts and no fairness guarantees).

Lifecycle contract (same as the climate cache lock, and for the same reason):
slot files are opened and flock'd but NEVER unlinked -- a slot releases when
its holder closes the fd or dies, and unlinking a path another process may
still hold flock'd creates two simultaneous "exclusive" locks on different
inodes. The pid/tag/start-time written into a slot file is observability
metadata only.
