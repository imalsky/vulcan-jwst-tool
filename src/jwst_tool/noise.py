"""Host-side noise interface: subprocess to the Pandeia worker + transit-depth error math.

The worker gives, per instrument mode, the per-native-pixel extracted stellar
flux and its 1-integration sigma. This module turns that into a transit-depth
uncertainty per spectral bin:

    depth = 1 - F_in/F_out
    var(depth)_pixel = (sigma_1int/flux)^2 * (1/n_int_in + 1/n_int_out) / n_transits
    var(depth)_bin   = sum(w^2 var_pixel) / (sum w)^2,  w = flux   (count-space)
    sigma_bin        = max(sqrt(var_bin), floor)         (PandExo floor convention)

The count-space combination is the variance of the SAME estimator detect.py
uses to bin the model (binning.build_operator) -- the sum-of-extracted-counts
bin depth every real reduction produces. The old inverse-variance combination
quoted the variance of a different (optimal-weights) estimator than the one
the model was binned with; in the photon-dominated limit the two agree.

The minimum floor follows PandExo semantics exactly (resolve_floor): a HARD
MINIMUM on the final binned uncertainty -- none, a constant ppm value, or a
user-supplied wavelength-vs-ppm model evaluated on the final bin wavelengths
with constant edge extension. It is NOT added in quadrature, NOT scaled with
the requested resolving power, and does NOT average down when transits are
added (the random term does; the floor caps it from below).

What this is, and is not: a Pandeia-extracted-noise BOX-TRANSIT APPROXIMATION
under the selected extraction/detector configuration -- an instrument-model
planning forecast. A per-mode parity suite against current PandExo (engine
2026.2, both sides) is COMPLETE (tests/parity/, REPORT.md): configuration,
timing, wavelength grids, and extracted flux match, and the sigma difference
is attributed to the noise model (Pandeia full extracted noise vs PandExo's
analytic fml), with this tool conservative. Absolute sigmas are still
pandeia-extracted-noise forecasts, NOT labeled PandExo-identical. Pandeia's
extracted noise includes photon (with the HgCdTe quantum-yield/Fano excess
variance below ~2 um), background, dark, and correlated read noise + IPC -- it
is NOT a time-series systematics model (1/f residuals, visit-long trends,
pointing/tilt events, limb-darkening and detrending covariance, stellar
heterogeneity). Real reductions can differ in either direction depending on
extraction and analysis choices, though unmodeled systematics commonly degrade
precision.

Results are cached by a hash of (star, modes, sat_limit, engine + refdata
versions) so the ETC runs once per star/instrument set and stale caches are
invalidated when the Pandeia backend changes.

# --- correlated-noise scenarios (EXPERIMENTAL) --------------------------------
# The floor is a hard minimum: wherever it binds, it lifts the per-bin variance
# from var_phot to floor^2. That LIFT -- the floor EXCESS,
#
#     excess^2 = max(0, floor^2 - var_phot)
#
# -- is a systematic budget, and treating it as white (bin-to-bin
# uncorrelated) is only one limiting assumption: real JWST transit-spectroscopy
# residuals are spectrally smooth (the generic finding of independent-pipeline
# comparisons, e.g. Holmberg & Madhusudhan 2023). A scenario RE-ALLOCATES the
# excess between a white part and a smooth part with a squared-exponential
# kernel in ln(lambda):
#
#     C = diag(var_phot + f_white * excess^2)
#         + (1 - f_white) * excess_i excess_j exp(-(ln wl_i - ln wl_j)^2 / 2 ell^2)
#
# PSD by construction (SE kernel Gram matrix, congruence-scaled by the per-bin
# excess amplitudes; the photon diagonal is strictly positive). The per-bin
# TOTAL variance is IDENTICAL in every scenario -- diag(C) = var_phot +
# excess^2 = max(var_phot, floor^2) = sigma_final^2 always -- so ranking
# changes between scenarios are attributable to correlation structure alone,
# never to a bigger error bar. Photon-dominated bins (floor not binding) carry
# no correlated part. f_white = 1 recovers the exact diagonal model
# (build_cov returns None: fast sigma path).
#
# These presets are EXPERIMENTAL stated ASSUMPTIONS bracketing the correlation
# structure, not measured or calibrated JWST covariances. They are excluded
# from headline results: the default scenario is "random" (exact diagonal,
# PandExo-style), and the GUI/README label the tier accordingly. ell is in
# ln-wavelength (0.05 ~ 5% wavelength scale; the G395H band spans ~0.6).
# "conservative" additionally profiles a per-detector-segment SLOPE nuisance
# (real per-visit fits float linear trends), on top of the per-segment
# offsets every scenario profiles.
# NOTE (2026-07-15 audit): because the correlated budget is the floor EXCESS
# max(0, floor^2 - var_phot), the correlated systematic is absent where photon
# noise dominates and fully present at N -> infinity -- it GROWS as transits
# average the photon term down. Template S/N (and Fisher forecasts) are
# therefore NOT monotone in n_transits under the correlated presets: they can
# peak at a finite transit count (where the floor just binds) and decline
# toward the floor-only limit. This is a property of the stated assumption,
# kept deliberately (it preserves the PandExo per-bin totals exactly, so
# scenario ranking differences are attributable to correlation structure
# alone); transits_to_target scans instead of gating on the limit there. A
# PSD-monotone additive-systematic model would need a NEW scenario family
# with different (documented) diagonal semantics -- never a silent swap.

    ``floor_spec`` is the PandExo-style minimum floor (resolve_floor: None,
    constant ppm, or a wavelength-vs-ppm table). Order of operations matches
    PandExo: (1) random variance for the requested observation, (2) binned in
    count space, (3) transits combined, (4) the floor evaluated on the final
    bin wavelengths, (5) sigma = max(sigma_random, floor).

    Returns dict(wl_center, sigma, n_pix, var_phot, floor, n_transits) over
    the operator's kept bins. ``var_phot`` is the random (photon/detector) bin
    variance AT the evaluated ``n_transits`` (it scales as 1/N, inflation
    included); ``floor`` is the resolved per-bin minimum (N-independent).
    Returning the two components separately is what lets callers extrapolate
    to other transit counts CORRECTLY -- sigma approaches the floor from
    above as N grows, never below it.

    ``noise_inflation`` is an OPTIONAL empirical sensitivity factor on the
    random (Pandeia) sigma, default 1.0 -- the Pandeia prediction as-is.
    Published achieved-vs-predicted ratios (COMPASS/Gordon+2025, Radica+2023,
    Bouwman+2023; see instruments.LITERATURE_NOISE_FACTORS) are
    program-specific, NOT a transferable calibration, so nothing is applied by
    default. Proportional noise: it averages down with transits, unlike the
    floor.
