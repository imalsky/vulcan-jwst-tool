"""Planet/system registry for the JWST instrument selector.

Pure data, importable by the light GUI path (no jax/vulcan/exojax imports).

Every planet runs on the SAME W39b-validated machinery: the WASP-39b SNCHO
photo network + 10x-solar FastChem baseline (the import-locked network), with
the planet identity injected through the existing hooks. Shared code path, not
per-planet validation -- the committed parity/live evidence is W39b-centered
(docs/audit_decisions_2026-07-21.md) --

    chemistry : cfg_overrides {Mp, Rp, r_star, orbit_radius, sflux_file, ...}
                (VULCAN derives gs = G*Mp/Rp^2; gs_cgs is converted to Mp at the
                boundary in forward.py. vulcan_chem.build_chem_model applies them
                before the pre-loop)
    RT        : profile {rp_cm, gs_cgs, rstar_cm}
                (exojax_rt.build_rt_model reads them for geometry/normalization)
    noise     : star dict -> pandeia phoenix SED + Ks normalization
    timing    : t14_hr -> in/out-of-transit integration split

Every planet (including WASP-39b) uses an isothermal structural baseline at a
representative temperature and a user-chosen isothermal / Guillot T-P
evaluated on-graph, with a constant Kzz. The WASP-39b GCM T-P/Kzz baseline
modes were removed 2026-07-13 (no GCM profile is ever silently substituted).

Values are literature defaults for PLANNING (all editable in the GUI):
WASP-39b Mancini+2018/Tsai+2023; HD 189733b Torres+2008 (a: Bouchy+2005);
HD 209458b Torres+2008 (a, gs from Southworth+2010); WASP-107b Piaulet+2021.
(Provenance audited against the NASA Exoplanet Archive 2026-07-15: every
numeric field within the literature spread.) Stellar UV: shipped VULCAN spectra,
nearest available spectral type (shown in the GUI, never silently swapped).

# Per-planet MEASURED structure tables bundled with vulcan_jax (atm/).
#
# TWO SEPARATE FACTS, deliberately not conflated:
#   tp_table          the table exists and is SELECTABLE for this planet
#   tp_table_default  a default run on it has been VERIFIED end-to-end here
#
# Shipping a table is not evidence that the tool converges on it. HD 189733 b
# has a perfectly good bundled profile that the solver does NOT certify at the
# default settings (measured 2026-07-22: longdy 0.0998 against the 0.1 gate but
# conv_normal False -- a stall exit, so the run correctly hard-refuses), while
# its analytic default converges in 36 s. Making that table the default would
# have turned a working planet into one that errors on arrival, so it is
# offered rather than imposed. `tp_table_note` carries the reason in both
# directions so neither the gap nor the caveat is silent.
#
# The tool runs every planet on the W39b cfg's FIXED chemistry grid
# (forward.CHEM_P_SPAN_DYN = 0.1 to 7.6e6 dyn/cm^2), so a table only has to be
# valid ACROSS THAT SPAN; rows deeper or higher are never evaluated. What
# disqualifies HD 209458 b is that its thermosphere is already inside the span.
